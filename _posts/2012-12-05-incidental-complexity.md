title: Incidental Complexity is Self Sabotage

Take the problem you have in front of you and reduce it to the simplest form you can in the time you have. The complexity of that problem definition is the tasks inherant complexity and everything else about your solution that adds complexity is incidental. Sound hard? It should - doing the easy thing is rarely the same as doing the simple thing.

Want to achieve strategic goals rather than just churning code? Want to work on successful projects rather than hard to maintain over budget projects? Want to explain things without baffling people? Work on reducing a problem to its simplest form quickly and efficency because in the long run not working on understanding a complex problem and making a simple solution is self sabotage.

Software Development is basically solving a sequence of inherantly complex problems and then making that solution understandable to the widest base of stakeholders possible. If you are not working on minimizing incidental complexity you are not working on the core problem of writing software. In my experience dilligent focus on that very core problem is what allows me to get better at a good pace and what keeps my skills relevent to new subdomains.

I have some ideas about how to measure incidental complexity, as have other people, so hopefully there will be a more practical post soon(tm).
