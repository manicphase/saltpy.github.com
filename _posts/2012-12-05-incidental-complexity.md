title: Incidental Complexity is Self Sabotage

Want to achieve strategic goals rather than just churning code? Want to work on successful projects rather than hard to maintain over budget projects? Want to explain things without baffling people? Work on reducing a problem to its simplest form quickly and efficiency because in the long run not working on understanding a complex problem and making a simple solution is self sabotage.

Every problem has complexity. Valuable problems often have a lot of complexity. Incidental complexity occurs when your solution adds to the problems inherent complexity. Sound hard? It should - doing the easy thing is rarely the same as doing the simple thing. Simple and easy are even more different when you look only at valuable problems.

Software Development is basically solving a sequence of inherently complex problems and then making that solution understandable to the widest base of stakeholders possible. If you are not working on minimizing incidental complexity you are not working on the core problem of writing software.

I have some ideas about how to measure incidental complexity, as have other people, so hopefully there will be a more practical post soon(tm).
