How many times have you seen a junior colleague come to you with a problem frustrated by days of trying to solve it and now tight on a deadline?

What about a peer asking your opinion without making sufficent information available for you to provide one?

What about a senior colleague overloaded and under the gun who doesn't have time to communicate or worse has no basis in documentation to point you at so you can involve yourself?

What about at daily standup when people delve into the minutiae of a technical solution, in other words done work, before briefly mentioning that they have a tough nut to crack again today?

It is the inverse law of communications at work - when you need to communicate the most your ability to communicate is often its most diminished but when you have no need to communicate you have plenty of achievements to talk about.

I am not too proud to say that I get help with things all the time, not all of it from my mate Google. I am very proud to say that when I get that help I have clear needs, good information to provide people and build systems, tests and version control that just works.

If you are a junior right now learn to track tasks, document and keep a projects code tidy before you learn your next language or framework. In the long run it will keep you doing good technical work longer with less stress not to mention allowing you to achieve things way above your pay grade.
